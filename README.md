# The approaching to Hand Gesture Recognition, Vehicle Color Recognition, and Handwritten digit recognition 
This project paper intends to take use of effective methods for solving the **Hand Gesture Recognition, Vehicle Color Recognition, and Handwritten digit recognition**.
--- 
The gesture recognition, after years of research, remains a difficult subject for the following reasons: outcomes of unclear recognition, unstable systems, and inaccurate recognition. Same for Vehicle Color Recognition: include incorrect olygon identification, insufficient pixel count for estimate in half-circles, and insufficient color contrast for segmentation in the movement. Naturally, Handwritten numbers identification yielded the best results, but I wish to continue researching this to find a better method. In this paper, we will just try to apply all the ideas and approaches we have learned throughout the course in an effort to find the most effective answer to each challenge. As a data foundation, i.e. data sets, the publicly available collection from kaggle is regarded.
